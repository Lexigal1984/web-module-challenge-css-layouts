    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <div class="aboutme">
        I am a mother of five children plus one stepson(from my current relationship). I been divorced once. Seperated from my other<br>
        husband for the last 5 years. I try to make sure my kids are happy and have the choice of what they want in mind. They contact<br>
        their father on their terms if they call him. It is on the father's side to call when he wants to talk otherwise. They have<br>
        their own opinion on things.<br><br>
        Well as of lately I was talking to my kids about life after high school and I got the same thing "I don't want to go to<br>
        college, you never finished college. Why should I even try." I have 2 kids out of high school and one in his freshman<br>
        year. I feel that I didn't set a good example. So I decide to go back to school and become a Full Stack Web Designer.
